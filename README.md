# Vanguard CX Digital Experiment Analysis
by Alejandro Figueroa, Bryan Frank, Dylan Sedeno

## Project Overview

### Context

You are a newly employed data analyst in the Customer Experience (CX) team at Vanguard, a US-based investment management company. Your first task involves analyzing the results of a digital experiment conducted by the team.

### The Digital Challenge

In the ever-evolving digital world, Vanguard aimed to enhance the user experience for their clients. They hypothesized that a more intuitive and modern User Interface (UI), along with timely in-context prompts (cues, messages, hints, or instructions provided to users directly within the context of their current task or action), could streamline the online process and encourage more clients to complete it.

### The Experiment

The experiment involved modifying the UI and introducing in-context prompts to observe whether these changes would lead to higher completion rates among clients.
